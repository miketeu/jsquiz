# The Challenge.
## Build a Quiz program that would allow the user to answer a series of questions against the clock. The user would lose time for each wrong answer and a final score would be shown.

There has been a lot to do in this challenge and much research that has been done to catch up with the necessary coding skills. There is much to be done to complete this project and it is on-going.

Thus far, the start button causes the front page to be hidden and the question page to open. The timer starts the countdown as soon as the page opens but has yet to trigger the final score.
The question and answer section has not been working satisfactorily - this section is now being rewritten.
